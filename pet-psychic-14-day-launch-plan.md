## Warning Signs (Act Immediately)

### Content Problems
```
⚠️ No video over 1K views after 3 days
   → Hooks aren't working; test different formats
   
⚠️ High views but no follows/downloads
   → Content doesn't lead to app; improve CTAs
   
⚠️ Comments are confused about what app does
   → Messaging unclear; simplify explanation
```

### App Problems
```
⚠️ Downloads but no readings generated
   → Onboarding friction; test the flow yourself
   
⚠️ Readings generated but no shares
   → Share feature broken OR readings aren't good enough
   
⚠️ Negative reviews mentioning same issue
   → Fix immediately; one bug can kill momentum
```

### Engagement Problems
```
⚠️ Comment response time >2 hours
   → Set up notifications; engagement is critical early
   
⚠️ Influencers not responding
   → Try different templates; may need warmer outreach
   
⚠️ Reddit posts getting removed
   → Read rules more carefully; too promotional
```

**YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED. NOW EXECUTE.**

This plan will work if you:
1. **Show up consistently** (post every single day)
2. **Engage relentlessly** (respond to EVERY comment)
3. **Iterate quickly** (double down on winners, cut losers)
4. **Stay authentic** (genuine > polished)
5. **Have fun** (your energy shows through)

The pet content market is massive. The concept is solid. The humor lands. Your job is distribution.

**Let's go viral. 🔮🐾**
