## Afternoon Work (1:13-1:16 PM)

**Request from Alex:** QA + Design evaluation for clearskin_app (doopss/clearskin_app)
- Dislikes white background with bubbles
- Wants best-in-class AI consumer app UX assessment

**Action:** Spawned 2 Opus sub-agents in parallel
1. `clearskin-qa` - Comprehensive QA review
2. `clearskin-design-research` - UX/UI evaluation vs best practices

**Results (both completed ~1:15 PM):**

### QA Report (4.5/10)
- **Critical issues (4):** TypeScript compilation fails, no state persistence, no real AI integration (fake timer), missing error boundaries
- **Important issues (6):** Memory leaks, no error handling, missing useEffect deps, no network state handling
- **Nice-to-haves (8):** Zero accessibility (0 a11y attributes in 5,074 lines), no testing, duplicate logic
- **Dependencies:** Clean (0 vulnerabilities), 5 outdated packages
- **File:** `clearskin_app_qa_report.md`

### Design Report (6.5/10)
- **Bubble problem identified:** `SplashScreen.tsx` has floating `GlassOrb` components = "2021-era clip-art aesthetic"
- **Main issues:** Warm terracotta palette feels natural wellness (not AI tech), no dark mode, glass effects have contrast issues, AI results lack confidence viz
- **What works:** Good loading states, solid component architecture, proper mobile-first patterns
- **Recommendations:** Remove orbs → gradient mesh, shift to blue primary (terracotta accent), add dark mode, confidence badges
- **Reference apps:** Perplexity, Tiimo, Claude
- **File:** `ClearSkin-Design-Evaluation.md`

**Kanban updates (1:16 PM heartbeat):**
- Updated Static Kanban: Added 2 completed cards, updated status message
- Logged to Mission Control: Both activities logged via openclaw-logger.ts
- Committed & pushed to GitHub

## Late Evening - Pet Psychic Outreach Planning (10:29-10:43 PM)

**Request from Alex:** Set up Instagram/TikTok outreach automation for Pet Psychic app

**Scope:**
- Browser automation via Chrome Browser Relay
- Extract pet names from profiles/captions/videos
- Personalize DM template with [Name] and [Pet Name]
- Send with human-like delays (20-30/day per platform)
- Track responses in spreadsheet

**Copy template:**
```
Hey [Name]! Love following [Pet Name]'s adventures 🐾

I launched an app that creates personality readings for pets (think Co-Star but for dogs/cats), and [Pet Name] has STRONG main character energy that would be perfect to feature.

Would you be interested in getting a reading for [Pet Name]? No obligations—just think it'd be hilarious to see what comes up.

The app is live on the App Store, and we'd love for you to give it a test.

- [Your Name]
```

**Name extraction strategy:**
- Profile bio/name
- Video captions (pattern recognition)
- Pinned comments
- Video screenshot analysis (text overlays)
- Fallback: "your pup/kitty" if name unclear

**Expected accuracy:** ~80% pet name extraction success

**Next steps (tomorrow):**
1. Test run on 3-5 accounts
2. Verify extraction accuracy
3. Get Chrome Browser Relay access
4. Get target list from Alex
5. Start outreach (20-30/day)

**Tracking:**
- ✅ Added to Kanban READY queue
- ✅ Committed & pushed to GitHub
- 🔔 Set reminder for tomorrow morning
