## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Budge MVP - 100% Complete ✅
**Timeline:** 10:34 PM - 11:19 PM EST (~3 hours total work)

**Completed Priorities:**
1. **Orb Improvements** - Organic breathing, phase offsets, enhanced warmth
2. **Dopamine Hit** - Single medium impact haptic on completion
3. **Focus Sounds** - Generated 5 audio files (brown noise, rain, café, white noise, fireplace), built SoundPicker component, wired to Focus screen
4. **Notifications** - Built useNotifications hook, wired to paywall for auto-scheduling
5. **Cleanup** - Deleted return screen

**Files Created:**
- `components/SoundPicker.tsx`
- `hooks/useFocusSound.ts`
- `hooks/useNotifications.ts`
- `assets/sounds/*.mp3` (5 files, 6.9MB each, 10min loopable)

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(main)/focus.tsx` - Sound picker integration
- `app/paywall.tsx` - Notification scheduling
- `hooks/useHaptics.ts` - Simplified to single impact
- `app/(main)/complete.tsx` - Haptic trigger
- `components/Orb.tsx` - Improved animations
- `config/budge-config.json` - Storage keys

**Status:** Ready for Alex to test

### 2. App Research & PDFs
**Timeline:** Throughout day

**Deliverables:**
- **GlowScan AI** (skin analysis) - $20-28K MRR by month 6
- **PawCheck AI** (pet health) - Ranked #1, fastest to $10K MRR
- **ManeCheck AI** (hair/scalp) - Ranked #3
- **NailCheck AI** (nail health) - Ranked #1 overall (deprioritized by Alex)
- **Payroll/Retirement Automation** - NOT recommended (narrow market, high complexity)

**Decision:** Focus on acne analysis app instead of dating niche (Alex said dating is "fully done")

---

### 3. Acne Analysis App - UX/UI Started
**Timeline:** 11:25 PM EST

**Created:**
- `acne-app-brief.md` - Full product vision, features, monetization
- `acne-app-wireframes.md` - 12 core screens with detailed flows

**Key Innovations:**
- Budget-first recommendations (show only what user can afford)
- Beauty philosophy matching (K-Beauty, Western Clinical, Clean, Minimalist, Medical-Grade)
- Pain point-driven (not generic advice)
- "What worked/didn't work" filtering
- Transparent AI with confidence scores
- Progress tracking + routine adjustment

**Next Steps:**
- High-fidelity Figma mockups
- Interactive prototype
- User testing

---

### 4. Web-Accessible Kanban Board
**Timeline:** 11:20 PM EST

**Created:** `kanban.html` - Live dashboard
- Access: http://localhost:8765/kanban.html
- Auto-updates every minute
- Shows NOW/NEXT/SOON/BACKLOG
- Mobile-responsive

**Running:** Python HTTP server on port 8765

---

## Decisions Made

1. **Budge Dopamine Hit:** Single medium impact (not triple-tap) - aligns with "warm not cheery" philosophy
2. **Audio Files:** Generated synthetically with ffmpeg (faster than sourcing from YouTube)
3. **Notifications:** Auto-enable after paywall (not in settings screen)
4. **Acne App Priority:** Deprioritize dating niche, focus on acne analysis (premier app with budget/philosophy matching)

---

## Context for Tomorrow

**Alex's Priority:**
1. Finish wiring Budge ✅ DONE
2. QA Budge 🚧 IN PROGRESS
3. Acne app UX/UI 🚧 STARTED (brief + wireframes done)
4. Don't focus on dating app (it's done)

**Projects Status:**
- **Budge:** 100% complete, ready for testing
- **Acne App:** Product brief + wireframes complete, next = Figma mockups
- **Dating Niche:** Deprioritized per Alex
- **Payroll SaaS:** Not recommended (see PDF)

**Alex is offline until ~11 AM EST tomorrow (12 hours)**

---

## Action Items for Next Session

1. **QA Budge** - Test orb, dopamine, focus sounds, notifications
2. **Acne App Figma Mockups** - High-fidelity designs for 12 screens
3. **Acne App Prototype** - Interactive Figma prototype
4. **Competitor Analysis (if time)** - Market research on existing acne apps

---

## Notes

- Alex wants proactive work across all projects
- Web Kanban board for mobile/desktop access (constantly updated)
- New focus: Acne analysis app as "premier" solution with budget-first approach
- Benjamin (@benjaminseda) now gets morning market digest too (1838020956)

## Autonomous Work System Setup (12:35 AM)

**Alex approved my recommendation for autonomous work. Set up:**

1. **HEARTBEAT.md** - Added nightly work block (11 PM - 7 AM)
   - Auto-checks Kanban for [AUTO] tagged tasks
   - Works 2-4 hours max per night
   - Morning summary at 7 AM
   - Silent updates (Kanban only, unless critical)

2. **DECISION-AUTHORITY.md** - Clear guidelines on what I can decide
   - ✅ I can decide: Technical, code, docs, research, design details
   - ⚠️ Ask first: Product direction, external comms, spending, data/privacy
   - 🤔 Gray area: Use judgment based on urgency, reversibility, impact

3. **Kanban Work Mode Tags** - Implemented
   - [AUTO] - Autonomous work approved
   - [REVIEW] - Needs Alex's review first
   - [BLOCKED] - Waiting on Alex
   - [PAUSED] - Don't touch

**Starting tomorrow:** Nightly autonomous work will execute automatically during heartbeat checks.
