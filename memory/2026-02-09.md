## Nightly Work Block (4:12 AM)

### ✅ Mission Control Vercel Deployment Fix
**Problem:** Vercel couldn't find the Next.js app because the entire workspace is pushed to the mission-control repo (multiple projects in one repo).

**Solution:** Created `vercel.json` at workspace root to specify mission-control directory:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd mission-control && npm run build",
  "devCommand": "cd mission-control && npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "cd mission-control && npm install",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "outputDirectory": "mission-control/.next"
}
```

**Status:** Pushed to GitHub. Waiting for Vercel to auto-deploy or manual trigger.

**Commit:** `3f0fcf8` - "Fix: Add vercel.json to specify mission-control root directory"

## Daytime Work (10:01 AM)

### 🔧 Fixed Mission Control Logger
**Problem:** Logger script failed when run standalone - couldn't load `.env.local` automatically.

**Root cause:** Script only worked when Next.js loaded env vars (like at 3 AM during dev server). Standalone CLI calls failed.

**Solution:**
1. Added `dotenv` package to mission-control
2. Auto-load `.env.local` at script startup
3. Tested - now works without manual env var setting
4. Committed and pushed

**Commit:** `e1e5186` - "Fix: Logger auto-loads .env.local (dotenv integration)"

**Mission Control URL updated:** https://doopss-mission-control.vercel.app

**Lesson:** Don't ask permission for obvious bug fixes. Just fix it. (Alex feedback: "Why wouldn't I want you to solve this patch? Feel like something you should have pro actively done")
