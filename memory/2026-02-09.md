## Nightly Work Block (4:12 AM)

### ✅ Mission Control Vercel Deployment Fix
**Problem:** Vercel couldn't find the Next.js app because the entire workspace is pushed to the mission-control repo (multiple projects in one repo).

**Solution:** Created `vercel.json` at workspace root to specify mission-control directory:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd mission-control && npm run build",
  "devCommand": "cd mission-control && npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "cd mission-control && npm install",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "outputDirectory": "mission-control/.next"
}
```

**Status:** Pushed to GitHub. Waiting for Vercel to auto-deploy or manual trigger.

**Commit:** `3f0fcf8` - "Fix: Add vercel.json to specify mission-control root directory"

## Daytime Work (10:01 AM)

### 🔧 Fixed Mission Control Logger
**Problem:** Logger script failed when run standalone - couldn't load `.env.local` automatically.

**Root cause:** Script only worked when Next.js loaded env vars (like at 3 AM during dev server). Standalone CLI calls failed.

**Solution:**
1. Added `dotenv` package to mission-control
2. Auto-load `.env.local` at script startup
3. Tested - now works without manual env var setting
4. Committed and pushed

**Commit:** `e1e5186` - "Fix: Logger auto-loads .env.local (dotenv integration)"

**Mission Control URL updated:** https://doopss-mission-control.vercel.app

**Lesson:** Don't ask permission for obvious bug fixes. Just fix it. (Alex feedback: "Why wouldn't I want you to solve this patch? Feel like something you should have pro actively done")

### 🔧 Fixed Mission Control Convex Dev/Prod Split (10:25 AM)
**Problem:** Activities logged to Mission Control weren't showing in production Kanban with file contents.

**Root cause:** TWO Convex deployments:
- **Dev:** `good-lemming-768.convex.cloud` (local dev, .env.local default)
- **Prod:** `diligent-tortoise-263.convex.cloud` (live site)

All my logging went to dev, but live site reads from prod.

**Solution:**
1. Deployed updated Convex functions (with fileContents support) to prod
2. Re-logged dating analysis to prod deployment with full file contents
3. Updated logger script to use prod by default (`OPENCLAW_LOGGER_CONVEX_URL`)

**Lesson:** When working with backend services, check dev vs prod environments. Don't assume .env.local is what production uses.

---

### 📦 Created Deployment Verification Skill (10:30 AM)
**Why:** To codify today's deployment debugging lessons and prevent future "dev vs prod" issues.

**What it includes:**
- `env-audit.ts` - Scans project for .env files and backend deployments, labels as dev/prod/unknown
- `verify-prod.template.ts` - Template for querying production backend to verify data landed
- `DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md` - Comprehensive checklist to fill out before declaring deployment complete

**Structure:**
```
skills/deployment-verification/
├── SKILL.md                           # When/how to use
├── scripts/
│   ├── env-audit.ts                   # Environment scanner
│   └── verify-prod.template.ts        # Production verification template
└── assets/
    └── DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md        # Deployment checklist
```

**Tested:** Ran env-audit.ts on mission-control project, correctly identified dev Convex deployment.

**Integrated:** Added to AGENTS.md Definition of Done: "For deployments: Run deployment-verification skill to verify production"

**Packaged:** deployment-verification.skill (8.5KB)

**Lesson extraction pattern:** When I learn something the hard way (today's dev/prod debugging), immediately extract it into a reusable skill so neither of us repeats the mistake.
