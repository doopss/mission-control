# APP #1: HEARTBREAK RECOVERY COMPANION
## "Your AI coach to win the breakup"

### 1. App Concept (1 sentence pitch)
An AI-powered breakup recovery app with no-contact tracking, ex-blocking tools, "revenge glow-up" milestones, and sharable progress cards for the healing journey.

### 2. Problem/Pain Point
**Why it hurts NOW:**
- 40% of US adults lost touch with 9+ friends during the pandemic
- Breakups trigger literal withdrawal symptoms (dopamine crashes)
- The New Yorker (Dec 2024) documented a "feverish boom in heartbreak apps"
- Post-breakup is a DEFINED MOMENT where people actively seek solutions
- The urge to text an ex is compulsive - users need immediate intervention

### 3. Target User
- **Age:** 18-35 (peak dating/breakup years)
- **Demo:** 60% women, social media heavy users
- **Platform behavior:** Active on TikTok, IG, Reddit r/BreakUps
- **Psychographic:** Going through acute pain, craving validation and structure

### 4. TAM Validation
- **Reddit:** r/BreakUps: **457K members** (grew from 294K→457K in 1 year)
- **Reddit:** r/heartbreak: **200K+ members**
- **Reddit:** r/ExNoContact: **150K+ members**
- **TikTok:** #breakup has **billions of views**
- **TikTok:** #glowup has **5.6M+ posts** (revenge glow-up is a category)
- **Market:** ~50M breakups occur annually in the US
- **Existing apps:** Mend, Aftr, Breakup Buddy prove market exists

### 5. Content Angle
What content would users naturally create:
- "Day 30 no contact streak" milestone cards
- "My post-breakup glow-up" before/after transformations
- "What I learned from my toxic ex" storytime
- "POV: My breakup app blocked me from texting him"
- "Ranking my healing milestones" tier lists

### 6. Viral Mechanics
- **Built-in sharing:** Milestone badges designed for IG stories
- **No-contact streaks:** Gamified like Duolingo, share-worthy
- **Revenge glow-up tracking:** Before/after photos native to the app
- **Community:** "We're all healing together" solidarity content
- **Controversy:** "Why I use an app to not text my ex" discourse

### 7. Competition
**What exists:**
- **Mend:** Generic, feels clinical, $15/mo - 100K+ downloads
- **Aftr:** Good concept but limited features
- **Breakup Buddy:** AI chatbot focused, not viral-optimized

**Why they suck:**
- Not designed for content creation/sharing
- No gamification or streak mechanics
- Miss the "revenge glow-up" angle entirely
- UI feels like therapy, not TikTok-native

### 8. Revenue Potential
- **Comparable:** Calm ($70/year), Headspace ($70/year)
- **Target price:** $12.99-19.99/month
- **Revenue model:** Freemium (basic tracking free, AI coach + premium features paid)
- **Upsells:** 1:1 coaching calls, breakup bootcamp courses ($99-299)
- **LTV estimate:** $50-150 per user (3-6 month retention during acute period)

### 9. Differentiation
- **Viral-first design:** Every feature built for IG Stories sharing
- **Gamification:** Streaks, badges, levels (Duolingo for heartbreak)
- **"Win the breakup" positioning:** Not therapy-speak, aspirational
- **AI "panic button":** When about to text ex, AI intervenes with tough love
- **Glow-up tracking:** Photo timeline integrated into core experience

### 10. Distribution
- **TikTok organic:** Breakup storytime content is evergreen viral
- **Reddit:** Direct engagement in r/BreakUps (authentic, not spammy)
- **UGC strategy:** Partner with breakup coaches/influencers
- **SEO:** "How to get over a breakup" is massive search volume
- **Paid:** FB/IG targeting recently single users

### 11. Build Complexity
**MEDIUM**
- Core features: streak tracker, journal, AI chat, photo timeline
- Tech stack: React Native, GPT API, basic ML for sentiment
- MVP timeline: 8-12 weeks
- Key challenge: AI personality that's supportive but not corny

### 12. PMF Indicators
- 457K Reddit members actively seeking solutions
- Breakup apps already monetizing (proves willingness to pay)
- New Yorker documenting boom = mainstream awareness
- "Revenge glow-up" is a cultural moment
- High intent: users in acute pain, not browsing casually
