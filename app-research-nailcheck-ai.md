## Fourth App Recommendation for Consumer App Factory

---

# 1. APP CONCEPT

## What is NailCheck AI?

**NailCheck AI** is a photo-based AI diagnostic app that analyzes fingernail and toenail photos to identify potential health issues including:
- Fungal infections (onychomycosis)
- Nutritional deficiencies (zinc, iron, biotin, B12)
- Circulation problems
- Thyroid indicators
- Early warning signs requiring medical attention

## Why NailCheck AI?

### The Problem It Solves

**Primary Pain Point:** Nail health issues are embarrassing, misunderstood, and often ignored until severe.

Key Statistics:
- **35+ million Americans** affected by nail fungus annually
- **92% of patients** report psychological/psychosocial impact from nail conditions
- **61.4% of people self-diagnose** rather than see a doctor (embarrassment/inconvenience)
- **50%+ of Americans** show symptoms but are unaware they have a fungal infection
- Many delay treatment for years, causing permanent damage

**Secondary Pain Points:**
- Nails can indicate vitamin deficiencies (zinc, iron, B12) before other symptoms appear
- Doctor visits for "just nail issues" feel wasteful/embarrassing
- Google image searches are unreliable and cause health anxiety
- Existing solutions are treatment products, not diagnostic tools

### The Solution

Take a photo → Get instant AI analysis → Understand your nail health → Get personalized recommendations

**Differentiator:** AI has been proven to **outperform dermatologists** in nail fungus diagnosis (Korean research study with 50,000 images achieved higher accuracy than 42 dermatology experts)
