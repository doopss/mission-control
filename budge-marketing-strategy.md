## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

#### **1. Goblin Tools (Free)**
- **Features:** Task breakdown (Magic ToDo), sensory tools
- **Strengths:** Free, simple, beloved by ADHD community
- **Weaknesses:** No body doubling, no progress tracking, no AI coach
- **Our Advantage:** AI body doubling + focus sounds + dopamine hits

#### **2. Finch (Freemium: $0-8/mo)**
- **Features:** Self-care pet, daily goals, gentle reminders
- **Strengths:** Cute, non-judgmental, gamified
- **Weaknesses:** Not task-focused, no body doubling, limited decomposition
- **Our Advantage:** Task-specific, deeper decomposition, real body doubling

#### **3. FLOWN (£25/mo = ~$32/mo)**
- **Features:** Virtual co-working sessions, body doubling, live facilitators
- **Strengths:** Real human facilitators, scheduled sessions
- **Weaknesses:** **Expensive**, scheduled (not on-demand), UK-focused
- **Our Advantage:** **$10/mo vs $32/mo**, on-demand 24/7, AI-powered

#### **4. Focusmate (Free-$9/mo)**
- **Features:** 1-on-1 video body doubling with strangers
- **Strengths:** Real humans, accountability
- **Weaknesses:** Scheduled slots fill up, requires camera, social anxiety barrier
- **Our Advantage:** No camera required, always available, less pressure

---

### Market Gap

**No app combines:**
1. **On-demand body doubling** (24/7 availability)
2. **Task decomposition to atomic level** (smallest possible steps)
3. **Warm AI coaching** (not robotic, not naggy)
4. **Focus sounds** (integrated, not separate app)
5. **ADHD-specific design** (low friction, high dopamine)

**Budge fills this gap.**

---

## Unique Value Propositions

### 1. **Body Doubling, But Make It AI**
**Messaging:** "Your always-available body double. No scheduling, no cameras, no judgment."

**Why it works:** ADHD brains need presence, not pressure. Budge provides the feeling of someone working alongside you without the social exhaustion.

---

### 2. **Tasks So Small, You Can't Fail**
**Messaging:** "Can't start? We'll break it smaller. Open laptop. Log in. Open document. You've got this."

**Why it works:** The "just do it" advice ignores executive dysfunction. Budge removes the activation energy barrier by making the first step impossibly small.

---

### 3. **Warm, Not Bossy**
**Messaging:** "Your brain is different, not broken. We're here to support, not scold."

**Why it works:** ADHD users have internalized shame. Budge's tone is a friend, not a drill sergeant.

---

### 4. **Focus Without Fighting Your Brain**
**Messaging:** "Brown noise. Rain sounds. Café ambience. Pick what your brain needs right now."

**Why it works:** Auditory stimulation helps ADHD brains focus. Budge integrates it seamlessly (no switching apps).

---

### 5. **Dopamine Hits That Don't Feel Childish**
**Messaging:** "Small win? Celebrate it. Your brain deserves the good chemicals."

**Why it works:** Gamification can feel patronizing. Budge's haptic feedback + warm affirmations feel respectful.

---

## Positioning Statement

**For ADHD adults who struggle to start tasks, Budge is a body-doubling app that breaks work into the smallest possible steps and provides warm, non-judgmental support—unlike rigid productivity apps that ignore how ADHD brains actually work.**
