## HOOK IMPROVEMENT TIPS

**Before using a hook, ask:**
1. Is the "other person" clear? (boyfriend, mom, roommate)
2. Is there tension/doubt? (didn't believe, laughed, thought crazy)
3. Is the payoff implied? (reading changes their mind)
4. Would YOU stop scrolling?

**Make it specific:**
- ❌ "Someone didn't believe" 
- ✅ "My boyfriend didn't believe"

- ❌ "The reading was surprising"
- ✅ "The reading exposed her double life"

**Add urgency/curiosity:**
- "...until I showed him THIS"
- "...the answer shocked us"
- "...I know too much now"
