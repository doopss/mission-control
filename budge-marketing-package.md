### Problem Section
**Headline:** You know exactly what to do. You just can't start.

**Body:**
It's the ADHD paradox — you're smart, capable, and you know what needs to happen. But when you sit down to do it? Your brain freezes.

- The task feels too big, so you put it off
- You open 47 tabs "to prepare" and get lost
- You start, get distracted, then beat yourself up
- You download another productivity app, use it for 3 days, abandon it

**It's not a willpower problem. It's a starting problem.**

---

### Solution Section
**Headline:** Budge makes starting stupidly easy

**How it works:**
1. **Dump your brain** — Throw in that overwhelming task (no judgment)
2. **We break it down** — Budge splits it into the tiniest possible first step
3. **Body double together** — Hit start. We'll be there, keeping you company
4. **Keep the momentum** — One tiny win leads to the next. No guilt if you pause.

**No complicated systems. No "hacks" that don't stick. Just you, finally finishing things.**

## EMAIL WAITLIST SEQUENCE (4 emails)

### Email 1: Welcome (Immediate)
**Subject:** You're in! Here's what to expect 🚀

**Body:**
Hey [Name],

Welcome to the Budge early access list!

You're here because productivity apps haven't worked for you. Because "just try harder" is toxic BS. Because you know you're capable — you just need the right support.

**Here's what Budge does differently:**

Most apps help you *organize*. Budge helps you *start*.

We break your overwhelming tasks into steps so small you can't talk yourself out of them. Then we body double with you — literally stay on screen while you do it.

No guilt. No streaks to break. No complicated system to maintain.

**What's next:**
• You'll get early access before the public launch
• Sneak peeks of the app as we build
• A chance to shape features (your feedback actually matters)

Questions? Just reply — I read every email.

Talk soon,
[Your name]

P.S. Know someone else with ADHD who's tired of productivity apps that don't get it? Forward this to them.

### Email 2: Education (Day 3)
**Subject:** Why body doubling works (the science)

**Body:**
Hey [Name],

Quick question: When's the last time you cleaned your entire apartment — but only when someone was coming over?

That's body doubling. And it's basically ADHD life support.

**The science:**
Having someone "present" (even virtually) activates your brain's accountability system. You're not alone, so your brain doesn't wander. Simple as that.

**Why most apps miss this:**
They give you tools to organize. But they leave you alone to execute. And "alone" is where ADHD brains struggle most.

Budge puts body doubling front and center. Hit start, and someone's there with you. No judgment. Just presence.

**Real talk:**
I built this because I needed it. I was tired of productivity advice written by neurotypical people for neurotypical people.

Budge is different. And I can't wait for you to try it.

[Your name]

P.S. Early access is coming soon. Watch your inbox.

### Email 3: Social Proof/Teaser (Day 7)
**Subject:** "I finally finished something" — beta tester feedback

**Body:**
Hey [Name],

Beta testers have been using Budge for 2 weeks. Here's what they're saying:

*"I actually finished a work project I'd been putting off for 3 weeks. The body double thing is magic."* — Sarah

*"Finally an ADHD app that doesn't make me feel like a failure when I miss a day."* — Marcus

*"The micro-tasks are genius. 'Open the document' is way less scary than 'Write the report.'"* — Jamie

**What's working:**
✓ Tasks getting done that sat for weeks
✓ No guilt when life happens
✓ Actually *starting* instead of just planning to start

We're polishing the final features before opening early access. You'll be among the first in.

Stay tuned,

## INSTAGRAM POST CAPTIONS (5 posts)

### Post 1: Relatable Meme
**Image:** ADHD task paralysis meme or "me vs the task" format

**Caption:**
POV: You have ADHD and the task is technically "simple"

You know what to do. You've done it before. But your brain is like "nah, not today" and suddenly it's 3 hours later and you've researched the history of staplers.

It's not a willpower problem. It's a starting problem.

Budge fixes the starting part. Link in bio for early access.

### Post 2: Carousel (Tips)
**Images:** 5 slides with tips

**Caption:**
ADHD-friendly ways to actually start tasks (save this):

1️⃣ Make it stupidly small — "open the doc" not "finish the project"

2️⃣ Body double — do it with someone (virtually counts)

3️⃣ Remove the pause point — prep everything so you can just *go*

4️⃣ No zero days — one tiny thing is a win

5️⃣ Guilt is not a strategy — beating yourself up doesn't work

Budge does #1 and #2 automatically. Join the waitlist — link in bio.

### Post 3: Behind the Scenes
**Image:** Screenshot of app or you working on it

**Caption:**
Why I built Budge:

I was tired of productivity apps that assumed I just needed to "get organized."

Bro. I have 17 to-do apps. Organization isn't the problem.

The problem is STARTING. The 10-foot wall between "I should do this" and "I'm doing this."

So I built something that tears down that wall:
→ Tasks broken into micro-steps
→ Body doubling built in
→ Zero guilt design

Early access waitlist is open. Link in bio if you're tired of apps that don't get ADHD.

### Post 4: Testimonial/Social Proof

**Caption:**
"Finally an ADHD app that doesn't make me feel like a failure when I miss a day."

This is why we don't do streaks. No "you broke your 47-day chain" guilt spiral.

Life happens. ADHD happens. The app should work *with* your brain, not against it.

Budge: Finally finish what you start — without the shame.
