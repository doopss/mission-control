# Pet Psychic TikTok Content Skill

## The Strategy
Create viral TikTok slideshows (6 slides) featuring curated pet photos run through the Pet Psychic app. No owner submissions — we source, create, and post our own content to build organic following.

---

## The 6-Slide Format (Locked)

| Slide | Content | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | **Hook Photo** — Real pet photo with text overlay | Stop the scroll |
| 2 | **Upload Screen** — Screen recording of photo being added to Pet Psychic | Show the process |
| 3 | **Loading Screen** — "Reading your pet's aura..." with pet photo in circle | Build anticipation |
| 4 | **The Reveal** — The reading result (punchline/insight) | Payoff moment |
| 5 | **Reaction Photo** — Pet photo reacting to/doing the thing mentioned | Emotional connection |
| 6 | **CTA** — "Get your pet's reading free — link in bio" + app screenshot | Drive downloads |

## Sourcing Pet Photos (Curated Approach)

### Where to Find Pets

**1. Pet Influencers (Best for reach)**
- Target: 10K-100K followers
- DM template: "Hi [name]! We love [pet name]. Would you let us feature them in a Pet Psychic reading? We'll tag you and promote your account to our followers."
- Rights: They give permission, you get content + their audience

**2. Stock Photo Sites (Unlimited supply)**
- Sources: Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay
- Search: "dog portrait," "cat funny face," "pet expressions"
- Filter: Commercial use allowed, high quality, expressive faces
- Target breeds: Golden retrievers (relatable), huskies (dramatic), tuxedo cats (judgmental), rescue mixes (emotional)

**3. Reddit (With permission)**
- Subreddits: r/aww, r/pets, r/animalsbeingderps, r/WhatsWrongWithYourDog
- Comment: "This pet has such personality! Would you mind if we featured them in our app? Full credit given."
- Most say yes for the exposure

**4. Personal Network**
- Friends, family, your own pets
- Easiest rights
- Personal stories = higher engagement

### Photo Selection Criteria

**Must-haves:**
- High quality (phone camera or better)
- Expressive face (judgmental, soulful, goofy, mysterious)
- Clear subject (pet fills 30%+ of frame)
- Natural or good lighting

**Nice-to-haves:**
- Context that adds story (messy room = chaos energy)
- Action shot (mid-bark, mid-jump)
- Eye contact with camera

**Avoid:**
- Blurry or low-res
- Multiple pets (confuses the hook)
- Stock-looking posed photos
- Sad/abused pet vibes

---

## Hook Formulas (Proven Patterns)

### Formula 1: The Relationship Dynamic
**Pattern:** [Relationship] + [didn't believe] → [showed them] → [reaction]

**Examples:**
- "My boyfriend didn't believe in pet psychics until I showed him his dog's reading"
- "My mom laughed at me for using this app until she saw what our cat said"
- "My roommate thought I was crazy talking to the dog — then we submitted him"

**Why it works:** People love relationship drama + pets

---

### Formula 2: The Secret Exposed
**Pattern:** [Pet]'s reading + [exposed secret/double life]

**Examples:**
- "My cat's psychic reading exposed her secret double life"
- "We asked what our dog does while we're at work — the answer shocked us"
- "I submitted my landlady's cat to a pet psychic — I know too much now"

**Why it works:** Curiosity gap + humor

---

### Formula 3: The Emotional Reveal
**Pattern:** [Rescue/older pet] + [past life or deep feelings]

**Examples:**
- "I asked what my rescue dog's past life was — the answer broke me"
- "My 14-year-old dog's reading made me cry in the vet parking lot"
- "We submitted our senior cat before she passed — her message destroyed us"

**Why it works:** High shareability, emotional connection

---

### Formula 4: The Relatable Humor
**Pattern:** [Universal pet behavior] + [pet's perspective on it]

**Examples:**
- "We asked what our golden retriever thinks about all day"
- "My cat's reading about 3am zoomies was too accurate"
- "I submitted my husky to find out why he screams at nothing"

**Why it works:** Every pet owner relates

---

### Formula 5: The Judgment
**Pattern:** [Pet looks judgmental] + [reading confirms it]

**Examples:**
- "My neighbor's dog judges me every morning — I finally know why"
- "My cat's resting face is judgmental — the reading confirmed my fears"
- "We asked what our dog really thinks of our decorating choices"

**Why it works:** Self-deprecating humor

---

## Reading Style Guide

### Voice/Tone
- **Sassy best friend** — roast the owner lovingly
- **Dramatic main character** — pet thinks they're the protagonist
- **Wise old soul** — profound insights (for emotional angles)
- **Chaotic gremlin** — unhinged energy (for funny angles)

### What Works
- Specific complaints ("You sing off-key in the shower")
- Mild roasting ("Your cooking is... acceptable")
- Main character energy ("This is MY house, you're just the staff")
- Relatable pet behaviors ("I bark at the door but I'm scared of the mailman")

### What Doesn't Work
- Generic compliments ("Your dog loves you" — boring)
- Too mean (actually offensive, not funny)
- Too long (lose attention)
- Confusing (unclear who is speaking)

---

## Sound Pairing Strategy

| Reading Type | Sound/Music | Examples |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Funny/Roasting** | Cartoon sound effects, "Oh no" sound, silly music | "What the dog doing," slide whistle, "Aww man" |
| **Emotional/Reveal** | Soft piano, nostalgic songs, emotional build-up | "Can we pretend that airplanes," "Golden hour" vibes, sad violin |
| **Shocking/Secret** | Record scratch, "Wait for it," dramatic pause | "Dun dun dunnn," "Plot twist" sound |
| **Wholesome/Cute** | Upbeat acoustic, happy ukulele, gentle bells | "Good vibes only," soft guitar |
| **Judgmental** | Side-eye sound effect, judgmental "hmm," sassy music | "Really? Really?" sound |

**Critical:** Trending sounds change weekly. Check TikTok's trending audio before posting.

---

## Weekly Content Calendar

### Posting Schedule: 2-3x Daily

| Day | Morning | Afternoon | Evening |
|-----|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Monday** | Emotional (rescue story) | Funny (roasting owner) | Judgmental cat |
| **Tuesday** | Relationship dynamic | Trending sound format | Dog chaos energy |
| **Wednesday** | Secret exposed | Emotional (senior pet) | Funny (3am zoomies) |
| **Thursday** | Relatable humor | Judgmental dog | Relationship dynamic |
| **Friday** | Secret double life | Emotional (past life) | Trending challenge |
| **Saturday** | Behind the scenes | Funny (food obsessed) | Wholesome moment |
| **Sunday** | User submission (when UGC ready) | Emotional | Prep for week ahead |

**Rotation:** Don't post same angle twice in one day. Mix emotions.

## Content Production Workflow

### Daily Workflow (AI Agent + Human)

**AI Agent Does (Automated):**
1. Select pet photo from curated library
2. Analyze expression/energy for hook angle
3. Write hook using proven formula
4. Generate reading using Pet Psychic app
5. Create 6-slide carousel:
   - Slide 1: Hook text overlay on pet photo
   - Slide 2: Screen recording of upload (5-sec clip)
   - Slide 3: Loading screen screenshot
   - Slide 4: Result screen
   - Slide 5: Reaction/personality photo
   - Slide 6: CTA with app screenshot
6. Write caption (hook + 3-5 hashtags)
7. Upload to TikTok as SELF_ONLY draft via Postiz API
8. Send WhatsApp message with:
   - Draft link
   - Caption text
   - Suggested sound type
   - Pet source (for credits)

**Human Does (60 seconds):**
1. Open TikTok draft
2. Pick trending sound that matches reading emotion
3. Paste caption
4. Add any on-screen text if needed
5. Hit publish
6. Reply to AI with "Posted" confirmation

## Analytics & Iteration

### Track Every Post

```json
{
  "content_id": "001",
  "date_posted": "2026-02-12",
  "pet_type": "dog",
  "breed": "golden_retriever",
  "hook_formula": "relationship_dynamic",
  "reading_tone": "sassy",
  "sound_type": "funny",
  "views": 45000,
  "likes": 3200,
  "shares": 890,
  "comments": 245,
  "profile_visits": 1200,
  "app_clicks": 85,
  "rating": "4_stars",
  "would_repeat": true
}
```

### Weekly Review Questions

1. Which hook formula performed best?
2. Which pet types got most engagement?
3. Which reading tones (sassy/emotional/wise) worked?
4. What sounds were trending?
5. What time of day performed best?
6. Which content should we double down on?

### Iterate Based on Data

- If "relationship dynamic" hooks get 3x views → do more of those
- If golden retrievers underperform → pause, test huskies
- If emotional readings get more shares → adjust ratio to 40% emotional
- If 8pm posts perform best → shift schedule

## Hashtag Strategy

**Always use (5 max):**
- #PetPsychic (branded)
- #DogTok or #CatTok (pet-specific)
- #PetReading (content-type)
- One trending hashtag (check daily)
- One niche hashtag (#RescueDog, #GoldenRetriever, etc.)

**Avoid:**
- #FYP (useless, TikTok ignores)
- #Viral (desperate)
- Too many hashtags (looks spammy)

---

## Caption Formulas

**Short & Punchy (Best for TikTok):**
```
[Hook text]

[One sentence context if needed]

#getpetreading #dogtok #[trending] #[breed]
```

**Examples:**
```
My boyfriend didn't believe in pet psychics until I showed him his dog's reading 😂

The accuracy is scary

#getpetreading #dogtok #trending #goldenretriever
```

```
I asked what my rescue dog's past life was — the answer broke me 💔

#getpetreading #rescuedog #emotional #petsoftiktok
```

## Failures to Avoid (Larry's Lessons)

**Learned from Oliver Henry & Larry:**

1. **Wrong image size** — Always 1024x1536 portrait
2. **Text too small** — 6.5% font minimum
3. **Text too high** — Bottom 15% only (avoid TikTok UI)
4. **Vague hooks** — Specificity wins ("my boyfriend" > "someone")
5. **No conflict** — Every hook needs tension/doubt
6. **Wrong sound** — Sound emotion must match reading emotion
7. **Posting at wrong time** — Test mornings vs evenings
8. **Giving up too early** — First 10 posts will suck. Keep iterating.

**The magic is in the iteration.**

Larry's first posts were embarrassing. Wrong sizes, bad hooks, unreadable text. But every failure became a rule. Every success became a formula.

Your first 10 posts will not be your best. Post anyway. Learn. Update this skill file. Get better.

The system compounds. The skill file grows. You win.
