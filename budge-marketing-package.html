<p><strong>App Name:</strong> Budge: ADHD Task &amp; Body Double</p>
<p><strong>Subtitle:</strong> Break tasks into tiny steps. Finish with a
buddy.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p><em>Finally finish what you start — without the guilt.</em></p>
<p>Budge is the ADHD-friendly task app that actually gets you moving. No
complicated systems. No toxic productivity vibes. Just you, your tasks
broken into stupidly small steps, and a body double who keeps you
company until it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>HOW IT WORKS:</strong> • Brain dump your overwhelming task •
Budge breaks it into the tiniest possible first step • Hit start — your
body double joins you • Finish one tiny thing. Then the next. Momentum
builds.</p>
<p><strong>BUILT FOR ADHD BRAINS:</strong> ✓ Micro-tasks you can’t
procrastinate ✓ Live body doubling (no drifting to distractions) ✓ Pause
anytime — no broken streaks, no shame ✓ Zero setup or maintenance
required ✓ No “productivity guilt” design</p>
<p><strong>WHY BUDGE WORKS:</strong> Most productivity apps assume you
just need to <em>organize</em> better. Budge knows the real problem is
<em>starting</em>. We remove the friction between “I should do this” and
“I’m doing this.”</p>
<p>Stop collecting apps. Start finishing things.</p>

<strong>[10-15s]</strong> This is why I built Budge
<strong>[15-25s]</strong> It breaks tasks into steps so tiny you can’t

<p><strong>[0-3s]</strong> ADHD productivity apps are gaslighting you
<strong>[3-10s]</strong> They say “just organize your tasks better” like
that’s the problem. <strong>[10-20s]</strong> The problem is STARTING.
Budge gets that. It makes the first step so small you can’t say no.

need smaller steps and someone there. <strong>[10-20s]</strong> That’s
literally it. That’s the whole secret. <strong>[20-28s]</strong> So I
built an app that does exactly that. Breaks tasks down. Body doubles

<p><strong>Body:</strong> Hey [Name],</p>
<p>Welcome to the Budge early access list!</p>
<p>You’re here because productivity apps haven’t worked for you. Because
“just try harder” is toxic BS. Because you know you’re capable — you
just need the right support.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what Budge does differently:</strong></p>
<p>Most apps help you <em>organize</em>. Budge helps you
<em>start</em>.</p>
<p>We break your overwhelming tasks into steps so small you can’t talk
yourself out of them. Then we body double with you — literally stay on
screen while you do it.</p>
<p>No guilt. No streaks to break. No complicated system to maintain.</p>
<p><strong>What’s next:</strong> • You’ll get early access before the
public launch • Sneak peeks of the app as we build • A chance to shape
features (your feedback actually matters)</p>
<p>Questions? Just reply — I read every email.</p>

<h3 id="email-2-education-day-3">Email 2: Education (Day 3)</h3>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Why body doubling works (the science)</p>
<p><strong>Body:</strong> Hey [Name],</p>
<p>Quick question: When’s the last time you cleaned your entire
apartment — but only when someone was coming over?</p>
<p>That’s body doubling. And it’s basically ADHD life support.</p>
<p><strong>The science:</strong> Having someone “present” (even
virtually) activates your brain’s accountability system. You’re not
alone, so your brain doesn’t wander. Simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>Why most apps miss this:</strong> They give you tools to
organize. But they leave you alone to execute. And “alone” is where ADHD
brains struggle most.</p>
<p>Budge puts body doubling front and center. Hit start, and someone’s
there with you. No judgment. Just presence.</p>
<p><strong>Real talk:</strong> I built this because I needed it. I was
tired of productivity advice written by neurotypical people for
neurotypical people.</p>
<p>Budge is different. And I can’t wait for you to try it.</p>

tester feedback</p>
<p><strong>Body:</strong> Hey [Name],</p>
<p>Beta testers have been using Budge for 2 weeks. Here’s what they’re
saying:</p>
<p><em>“I actually finished a work project I’d been putting off for 3
weeks. The body double thing is magic.”</em> — Sarah</p>
<p><em>“Finally an ADHD app that doesn’t make me feel like a failure
when I miss a day.”</em> — Marcus</p>
<p><em>“The micro-tasks are genius. ‘Open the document’ is way less
scary than ‘Write the report.’”</em> — Jamie</p>
<p><strong>What’s working:</strong> ✓ Tasks getting done that sat for
weeks ✓ No guilt when life happens ✓ Actually <em>starting</em> instead
of just planning to start</p>
<p>We’re polishing the final features before opening early access.
You’ll be among the first in.</p>

(save this):</p>
<p>1️⃣ Make it stupidly small — “open the doc” not “finish the

<p>2️⃣ Body double — do it with someone (virtually counts)</p>
<p>3️⃣ Remove the pause point — prep everything so you can just
<em>go</em></p>
<p>4️⃣ No zero days — one tiny thing is a win</p>
<p>5️⃣ Guilt is not a strategy — beating yourself up doesn’t work</p>

<p><strong>Image:</strong> Screenshot of app or you working on it</p>
<p><strong>Caption:</strong> Why I built Budge:</p>
<p>I was tired of productivity apps that assumed I just needed to “get
organized.”</p>
<p>Bro. I have 17 to-do apps. Organization isn’t the problem.</p>
<p>The problem is STARTING. The 10-foot wall between “I should do this”
and “I’m doing this.”</p>
<p>So I built something that tears down that wall: → Tasks broken into
micro-steps → Body doubling built in → Zero guilt design</p>
<p>Early access waitlist is open. Link in bio if you’re tired of apps
that don’t get ADHD.</p>
