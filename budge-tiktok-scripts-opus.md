Each script is engineered for maximum retention with second-by-second breakdowns, psychological hooks, and production notes.

---

## VIDEO #1: The Laundry Equation
**Duration:** 47 seconds  
**Format:** Face-to-camera + Screen recording hybrid  
**Emotional Arc:** Despair → Recognition → Hope → Relief

### THE HOOK (0-3s)
**[VISUAL]** Close-up of person's face, dead-eyed stare, camera slowly pulls back to reveal MOUNTAIN of laundry behind them.

**[AUDIO]** "This pile has been here so long it's paying rent."

**[TEXT OVERLAY]** `The laundry has been there for: 9 days`

**[MUSIC]** First 3 seconds of "Oh No" by Kreepa OR trending "it's giving unhinged" sound

### THE RECOGNITION (3-12s)
**[VISUAL]** Quick cuts: Person gesturing at pile, overwhelmed expression, then sitting on floor defeated.

**[SCRIPT]**
"And every time I look at it, my brain does this fun thing where it calculates:

*[Count on fingers, increasingly frantic]*

Sorting. Washing. Drying. Folding. Putting away. Finding hangers. Realizing I don't have enough hangers. Ordering hangers. Forgetting to order hangers—"

**[TEXT OVERLAY]** 
- `My brain: calculating...` (3s)
- `Result: TOO MANY STEPS` (6s)
- `Executive dysfunction: ACTIVATED` (9s)

### THE PIVOT (12-28s)
**[VISUAL]** Cut to app demo. Clean, clear screen recording with subtle zoom on key features.

**[SCRIPT]**
"So I opened Budge and said: 'Help me do laundry.'

*[Show typing into app]*

And it didn't say 'do your laundry.'

It said:

*[Show app interface, each step appearing]*

'Pick up the thing closest to your foot.'

*[Beat]*

Not the whole pile. Not even a category. Just... the nearest thing.

So I did."

**[TEXT OVERLAY]**
- `Budge: "What's the task?"` (13s)
- `Step 1: Pick up the thing closest to your foot` (18s)
- `That's it. That's the step.` (23s)

### THE PAYOFF (28-40s)
**[VISUAL]** Time-lapse of laundry getting done, but NOT perfectly—pile moves to "clean but unfolded" basket. Realistic, not aspirational.

**[SCRIPT]**
"Twenty-two steps later—not timed, just whenever I was ready—the laundry mountain is now a laundry... hill.

*[Camera on "clean but chaotic" laundry]*

Is it folded? No. Is it clean? YES.

And my brain didn't have to see all twenty-two steps at once. Just the next one. And the next one. And—"

**[TEXT OVERLAY]**
- `22 tiny steps` (29s)
- `Zero overwhelm` (33s)
- `Clean-ish laundry: ACHIEVED` (36s)

### THE CTA (40-47s)
**[VISUAL]** Return to face-to-camera, visibly lighter energy. Casual point toward camera.

**[SCRIPT]**
"Budge is basically a body double that lives in your phone and doesn't judge your laundry situation. Link's in bio if your pile is also paying rent."

**[TEXT OVERLAY]** `Your task, but smaller 🧠 @trybudge`

**[MUSIC]** Fade out on satisfying "ding" sound

## VIDEO #2: The Email That Took Four Days
**Duration:** 52 seconds  
**Format:** Split-screen storytelling  
**Emotional Arc:** Anxiety → Understanding → Action → Vindication

### THE HOOK (0-3s)
**[VISUAL]** Split screen: Left side shows "Draft" email from 4 days ago. Right side shows person's face, hollow stare.

**[AUDIO]** "This email has been in my drafts longer than some of my relationships."

**[TEXT OVERLAY]** `Draft saved: Tuesday | Today: Saturday`

**[MUSIC]** Slowed-down "Heather" or anxious piano trending sound

### THE PROBLEM (3-15s)
**[VISUAL]** Close-up on email draft. Cursor blinks. Nothing happens. Cut to person at desk, head in hands.

**[SCRIPT]**
"And it's not even a HARD email. It's literally:

*[Read from screen, increasingly stressed]*

'Hi Sarah, confirming our meeting next week.'

THAT'S IT. But my brain?

*[Knock on head]*

My brain sees: 'Write an email that could be misinterpreted and ruin your professional reputation forever.'"

**[TEXT OVERLAY]**
- `The email: 1 sentence` (5s)
- `My brain's version: A CAREER-ENDING CATASTROPHE` (9s)
- `Time spent thinking about it: 4+ hours` (13s)

### THE SOLUTION (15-35s)

**[SCRIPT]**
"So I told Budge: 'I need to send this email and I've been avoiding it for four days.'

And it said—I love this—

*[Show app]*

'Okay. Step one: Open the draft.'

Not write. Not send. Just... open it.

Then: 'Read what you already wrote.'

Then: 'Add the word "Thanks" before your name.'

Then: 'Read it one time out loud.'

Then—and only then—'Put your finger on the send button.'

Notice it didn't say press. Just... put your finger there."

**[TEXT OVERLAY]**

- `Step 2: Read what you wrote` (20s)
- `Step 3: Add "Thanks"` (23s)
- `Step 4: Read it out loud` (26s)
- `Step 5: Finger on send button` (29s)
- `Step 6: Press when ready` (32s)

### THE PAYOFF (35-45s)
**[VISUAL]** Screen shows "Message sent" confirmation. Cut to person doing celebratory fist pump, but understated—not performative.

**[SCRIPT]**
"Sent.

Four days of anxiety. Six steps. Ninety seconds of actual doing.

*[Look directly at camera]*

This is what ADHD people mean when we say 'I can't start.' We CAN do the thing. We just can't see HOW to start the thing.

Budge shows me the first step so small that my brain can't say no."

**[TEXT OVERLAY]**
- `4 days of dread` (36s)
- `90 seconds of action` (38s)
- `Sent: ✓` (41s)

### THE CTA (45-52s)

**[SCRIPT]**

**[AUDIO]** "It's almost 3 PM and showering still feels like a side quest I'm not leveled up for."

**[TEXT OVERLAY]** `Day 3 of "I'll shower later"`

**[MUSIC]** Video game "quest failed" sound into lo-fi

### THE REFRAME (3-18s)
**[VISUAL]** Person sits up, talks directly to camera. Raw, unfiltered lighting—intentionally "real."

**[SCRIPT]**
"And I know how that sounds. 'Just shower. It's not hard.'

Okay but for my brain, 'take a shower' isn't one task. It's:

*[Rapid fire, counting on fingers]*

Get up. Walk to bathroom. Take off clothes. Turn on water. Wait for temperature. Get in. Wet hair. Shampoo. Rinse. Conditioner. Wait. Rinse. Soap body. Rinse. Turn off water. Get out. Dry off. Lotion? Moisturize? Get dressed. What do I wear. Hair? Do I blow dry? Where's the—

*[Stops, exhales]*

That's not a shower. That's a PROCESS."

**[TEXT OVERLAY]**

**[SCRIPT]**
"So I opened Budge and said: 'I need to shower but I can't start.'

*[Show app breaking it down]*

That's it. Not 'go shower.' Just change your position.

*[Show completing step]*

Done. Dopamine hit. Next step: 'Put your feet on the floor.'

Done. Next: 'Stand up.'

It walked me to the bathroom in SIX steps before I even thought about water.

And by then? I was already there. Might as well turn on the faucet.

*[Snap]*

That's the trick. You don't have to want to do the whole thing. You just have to do the next tiny thing until you're already doing the thing."

- `Step 2: Feet on floor` (23s)

### THE PAYOFF (40-48s)
**[VISUAL]** Cut to: Wet hair, clean face, visible relief. Good lighting now—subtle upgrade from the "before."

**[SCRIPT]**
"Showered by 3:15.

Not because I suddenly had more motivation. Because I had a system that didn't require motivation.

Just: What's the next 10-second thing?"

**[TEXT OVERLAY]**

**[MUSIC]** Intense, anxiety-inducing sound (Interstellar "No Time for Caution" snippet or trending panic audio)

### THE SPIRAL (3-12s)

**[SCRIPT]**
"And I'm doing that thing—you know that thing—where you're SO stressed that you can't actually DO anything, so you just... exist in the panic?

*[Stare at ceiling]*

Is it my best work? No. Is it done? YES.

And here's the secret: Budge kept checking in. Every 5 minutes: 'Keep going or need a break?' 

I didn't have to hold the whole thing in my head. I just had to do 5 minutes. Then another 5 minutes. Then another.

Twelve 5-minute chunks. Not one impossible 2-hour task."

When you say '2-hour task,' you SEE a 2-hour task.

When I hear '2-hour task,' I see a formless void of unknown steps, unclear starting points, and infinite ways to fail.

*[Gesture at screen]*

This project isn't 'one 2-hour thing.' It's like... forty 3-minute things in a trench coat.

My brain needs to see those forty things or it literally cannot start."

But my brain treats phone calls like:

*[Count fears]*

What if they don't answer? What if they DO answer? What if I forget what to say? What if there's an awkward silence? What if my voice sounds weird? What if I mishear something? What if I say 'you too' when they say 'have a good call'—

## VIDEO #10: Self-Care Is Not Simple
**Duration:** 53 seconds  
**Format:** Gentle, validating tone  
**Emotional Arc:** Struggle → Understanding → Tenderness → Self-compassion

### THE HOOK (0-3s)
**[VISUAL]** Person lying on couch, phone playing a "self-care routine" video in background. They're not moving.

**[AUDIO]** "Everyone says self-care is the answer, but nobody mentions that self-care is also a task."

**[TEXT OVERLAY]** `Self-care requires: Executive function | ADHD provides: ❌`

**[MUSIC]** Soft, melancholic indie sound

### THE TRUTH (3-18s)
**[VISUAL]** Person sits up, talks to camera with vulnerability.

**[SCRIPT]**
"I want to take care of myself. I really do.

But 'do a face mask' or 'take a bath' or 'journal your feelings'—those aren't simple things for my brain.

Face mask means: Find it, wash face, apply it, wait, wash it off, moisturize.

Bath means: Clean the tub?, run water, find bath stuff, undress, get in, sit still with my thoughts, get out, dry off, now I'm cold—

*[Exhausted sigh]*

Self-care shouldn't require this much executive function."

**[TEXT OVERLAY]**
- `"Just take a bath"` (5s)
- `My brain: That's 12 steps and thinking time` (9s)
- `Self-care needs: Energy I don't have` (14s)

### THE GENTLENESS (18-38s)
**[VISUAL]** Budge app with self-care task. Softer UI focus, gentle progression.

**[SCRIPT]**
"So I told Budge: 'I want to take a bath but I can't make it happen.'

And it didn't say 'just do it.'

It said:

*[Show app]*

'Stand up from where you are.'

*[Stand up]*

'Walk toward the bathroom.'

*[Walk]*

'Turn on the water. Don't get in yet. Just start the water.'

*[Turn it on]*

'While it fills, find one thing that smells nice.'

*[Find it]*

'Okay. Get in when you're ready.'

*[Beat]*

There's something about being TOLD to take care of yourself. Step by step. With patience.

It felt like being parented. In a good way."

**[TEXT OVERLAY]**
- `Step 1: Stand up` (20s)
- `Step 2: Walk to bathroom` (23s)
- `Step 3: Turn on water` (26s)
- `Step 4: Find something nice` (29s)
- `Step 5: Get in when ready` (32s)
- `Permission to be gentle with yourself` (36s)

### THE PAYOFF (38-47s)
**[VISUAL]** Person in bath (appropriately filmed), calm face, candle lit.

**[SCRIPT]**
"First bath in months.

Not because I finally 'motivated myself.'

Because someone broke it down until my brain could actually do it.

That's not weakness. That's working WITH your brain instead of against it."

**[TEXT OVERLAY]**
- `First bath: Months` (39s)
- `Motivation required: 0` (42s)
- `Support required: Yes, and that's okay` (45s)

### THE CTA (47-53s)
**[VISUAL]** Soft lighting, peaceful expression.

**[SCRIPT]**
"If self-care feels like another item on an impossible to-do list, let Budge make it possible. Link in bio."

**[TEXT OVERLAY]** `Self-care that actually happens @trybudge`

## Hook Formulas (Proven Patterns)

### 1. The Time Confession
**Formula:** "[Duration] and I still haven't [basic task]"
- "It's 3 PM and I still haven't showered"
- "This email has been in drafts for 4 days"
- "I've been 'about to start' for 3 hours"

### 2. The Quantity Paradox
**Formula:** "[Simple task] should be easy but my brain sees [overwhelming breakdown]"
- "It's just ONE email but my brain sees..."
- "Dishes = 1 task? My brain: actually 47 decisions"

### 3. The Dark Humor Confession
**Formula:** "[Extreme avoidance] rather than [simple task]"
- "I'd rather starve than go grocery shopping"
- "I would simply pass away before making this phone call"
- "The pile has been there so long it's paying rent"

### 4. The Recognition Hook
**Formula:** "POV: [Highly specific ADHD experience]"
- "POV: You've been staring at this pile for 3 days"
- "POV: The email is written, you just can't hit send"
- "POV: You're too overwhelmed to do the thing that would make you less overwhelmed"

### 5. The Validation Hook
**Formula:** "Nobody talks about how [ADHD struggle] isn't [misconception]"
- "Nobody talks about how 'just start' doesn't work for ADHD brains"
- "Nobody mentions that self-care is also an executive function task"

### 6. The "Why Does" Question
**Formula:** "Why does [simple task] take me [absurd time/effort]?"
- "Why does sending ONE email take 4 hours?"
- "Why does 'getting ready' take 3 hours?"
- "Why can't I just... do the thing?"

## Engagement Strategy

### First 30 Minutes After Posting (Critical)
1. **Respond to EVERY comment** within first 30 min
2. **Ask follow-up questions** to generate more comments
3. **Heart comments** that share personal stories (builds community)

### Comment Response Templates

**For "This is me" comments:**
> "RIGHT?? Which task is currently haunting you? 👀"

**For "What's the app?" comments:**
> "It's called Budge! Link's in bio. It's literally changed how I function 🧠"

**For "I need this" comments:**
> "Your sign to try it tbh. What task would you break down first?"

**For skeptical comments:**
> "I was skeptical too! But breaking things into steps small enough my brain can't say no actually works. Might not be for everyone but changed my life"

**For personal story shares:**
> "I feel this SO hard. [brief validation]. You're not alone in this 💙"

### Pin Strategy
- Pin a **testimonial comment** (social proof)
- Or pin your own **CTA comment** with link reminder
- Change pinned comment weekly to keep fresh

### Duet/Stitch Opportunities
1. **Duet** viral ADHD struggle videos with "here's what I do" overlay
2. **Stitch** "productivity advice" videos with "this doesn't work for ADHD because..."
3. **Duet** other ADHD creators (cross-promotion, community building)
4. **Stitch** "day in my life" fails with Budge solution
