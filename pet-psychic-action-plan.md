Subject: Mystical AI app that "reads" your pet's mind (and roasts you in the process)

Hi [Name],

Pet Psychic is a new app that gives pets "psychic readings" using AI - think fortune teller meets pet comedy.

It's generating readings like:
• "That spot on the couch was won in a war. You were there. The humans were not."
• "You have been documenting the household movements. The humans believe this is adorable. They are mistaken."

We're launching this week and I thought [Publication] readers would love this. Would you be interested in:
- Trying it with your own pet?
- A demo/interview?
- Early access for a story?

Happy to send screenshots, app access, or whatever helps!

[Your name]
