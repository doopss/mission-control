## Video #1: The Laundry Mountain
**Hook (0-3s):** "POV: You've been staring at this pile of laundry for 3 days"

**Body (3-45s):**
*Camera shows massive laundry pile*

"Here's what my ADHD brain sees: One GIANT impossible task.

But Budge doesn't do that.

*Open app, show interface*

It breaks it down:
1. Pick up one shirt
2. Carry it to washer
3. Turn on washer

That's it. That's the whole task right now.

And when I'm done? It celebrates. Dopamine hit. ✅

Then it asks: 'Want to do the next tiny step?'

Sometimes I say yes. Sometimes I'm done. Both are valid.

But that ONE shirt is now clean. Progress > perfection."

**CTA:** "ADHD body doubling that actually gets it. Link in bio."

**Text overlay:**
- "ADHD paralysis be like 😵‍💫"
- "Budge: Your task, but ATOMIC"
- "One step >>> Zero steps"

**Music:** Chill lo-fi or trending ADHD sound

## Video #2: The Email
**Hook (0-3s):** "Why does sending ONE email take me 4 hours?"

**Body (3-50s):**
*Show email draft open, cursor blinking*

"Because my brain sees:
- Open email ❌ too vague
- Write perfect response ❌ too hard
- Hit send ❌ what if it's wrong???

Budge sees it different:

*Open app*

Step 1: Type 'Hi [Name]'
...that's it. That's the step.

Step 2: Write one sentence about the thing
Step 3: Add 'Thanks, [Your name]'
Step 4: Read it once
Step 5: Click send before you overthink

And it STAYS WITH ME. Like a body double who doesn't judge.

Took me 8 minutes instead of 4 hours."

**CTA:** "On-demand body doubling for ADHD. Try Budge."

**Text overlay:**
- "Email anxiety is real"
- "Your brain: ❌ My brain: ✅"
- "Smallest possible step"

**Music:** Upbeat, slightly anxious energy

## Video #3: The Shower Standoff
**Hook (0-3s):** "It's 3 PM and I still haven't showered because..."

**Body (3-45s):**
*Camera on messy hair*

"...showering feels like:
- Undress
- Adjust water
- Wash hair
- Condition
- Wash body
- Dry off
- Get dressed again
- Style hair

EIGHT STEPS. My ADHD brain said 'nope, too much.'

So I asked Budge to break it down.

*Show app*

Current step: 'Stand up and walk to bathroom'

That's IT. Not 'go shower.' Just... go to the room.

Once I'm there? 'Turn on water.'

It meets me where I am. No shame. No 'just do it.'

Baby steps that actually work.

By the way, I'm showered now. 🚿"

**CTA:** "Body doubling app for ADHD brains. Link in bio."

**Text overlay:**
- "Shower = final boss 🎮"

**Body (3-50s):**
*Fast cuts, panic energy*

"Timer ticking. Brain frozen. Why am I like this???

Old me: Doom scroll until it's too late

New me: Open Budge

*Show app interface*

'You have 2 hours. Let's do 5-minute chunks.'

Step 1: Open the document (5 min timer starts)
Step 2: Write the title
Step 3: Bullet point 3 main ideas

It MAKES ME STOP between steps. No endless 'flow state' that never comes.

Finished in 1 hour 20 minutes.
Not perfect. But DONE.

And that's the whole point."

**CTA:** "ADHD-friendly task management. Get Budge."

**Text overlay:**
- "ADHD time blindness ⏰"
- "Panic mode: ON"
- "5-min chunks = life saver"

## Video #5: The Dishes
**Hook (0-3s):** "Nobody's coming to save you from the dish mountain."

**Body (3-45s):**
*Pan across sink full of dishes*

"My therapist said 'just do one dish.'

Cool. WHICH ONE. WHERE DO I START.

Budge said:

*Open app*

'Pick up ONE fork. Rinse it. Put it in dishwasher.'

Done? Dopamine. ✅

'Want to do the next fork?'

Yes? Cool. No? Also cool.

20 minutes later: Sink is empty.

Not because I committed to 'doing the dishes.'

Because I committed to doing ONE fork. Twenty times.

This is how ADHD brains work. Meet us there."

**Text overlay:**
- "Dishes = ADHD final boss"

## Video #6: The Morning Routine
**Hook (0-3s):** "Why does it take me 3 hours to leave the house?"

**Body (3-50s):**
*Show person still in PJs at 11 AM*

"Because 'get ready' is like 47 steps.

And my brain sees it as one GIANT thing and just... no.

Budge breaks it down:

*Show app*

'Sit up in bed' ← Literally step 1

Then: 'Stand up'
Then: 'Walk to bathroom'
Then: 'Brush teeth for 2 minutes'

It doesn't let me skip ahead or spiral into decision fatigue.

One. Thing. At. A. Time.

Out the door in 45 minutes instead of 3 hours.

Is that normal people speed? No.

Is it MY speed? Yes. And that's valid."

**CTA:** "ADHD mornings, solved. Link in bio."

**Text overlay:**
- "Time blindness is REAL"
- "Budge: Your morning coach"

## Video #7: The Grocery Run
**Hook (0-3s):** "I'd rather starve than go to the grocery store."

**Body (3-45s):**
*Empty fridge shot*

"Not because I'm lazy.

Because 'go grocery shopping' means:
- Make a list
- Find my keys
- Drive there
- Park
- Walk around the store
- Remember what I needed
- Check out
- Carry bags to car
- Drive home
- Unload
- Put away

ELEVEN STEPS. Brain says 'nah.'

Budge says:

*Show app*

'Step 1: Open Notes app and write "milk"'

That's it. Not 'make a perfect list.' Just... write one thing.

Next step unlocks when I'm ready.

Got groceries in 40 minutes.
Didn't forget the milk.
Didn't have a meltdown."

**CTA:** "Task breakdowns for ADHD. Get Budge."

**Text overlay:**

## Video #8: The Work Project
**Hook (0-3s):** "Boss: 'This should take 2 hours' / My ADHD brain: *error 404*"

**Body (3-50s):**
*Staring at blank screen*

"Neurotypicals see: One 2-hour task

I see: ?????

No starting point. No structure. Brain = frozen.

Budge turns it into:

*Show app*

'Open the file' (2 min)
'Read the instructions' (5 min)
'Write the first sentence' (3 min)

It TIMES me. I can't spiral.

And between steps? It asks: 'Need a break?'

Sometimes yes. Sometimes no.

But either way, I'm making progress.

Finished the project in 2.5 hours instead of... never."

**CTA:** "ADHD-friendly work mode. Try Budge."

**Text overlay:**
- "Task initiation = impossible"
- "Budge: Structure on demand"
- "Timed steps = focus"

**Music:** Work productivity lo-fi

## Video #9: The Phone Call
**Hook (0-3s):** "I've been avoiding this phone call for 3 weeks."

**Body (3-45s):**
*Staring at phone with anxiety*

"It's just a 5-minute call.

But my brain sees:
- Find the number
- Dial
- Wait on hold
- Explain the thing
- Small talk
- Say goodbye without being weird

SIX WAYS TO FAIL.

Budge sees:

*Show app*

'Find the number in your contacts'

Done? ✅

'Press call'

Done? ✅

'Say: Hi, I need to [thing]'

It SCRIPTS it. No guessing.

Call done in 4 minutes.

Why did I wait 3 weeks for this."

## Video #10: The Self-Care
**Hook (0-3s):** "Self-care is great until you have ADHD."

**Body (3-50s):**
*Sitting on couch, scrolling*

"Everyone: 'Just relax! Take a bath!'

Me: But that requires:
- Running water
- Finding bath stuff
- Sitting still
- Not drowning in thoughts

Too many steps. Never happens.

Budge makes it stupid simple:

*Show app*

'Walk to bathroom'
'Turn on faucet'
'Add soap'
'Get in'

Literally tells me to GET IN THE BATH.

Because sometimes I need that.

No shame. No judgment.

Just: Here's the next tiny thing.

Took a bath for the first time in months.

Felt like a functional human."

**CTA:** "Self-care that actually happens. Link in bio."

**Text overlay:**
- "Self-care is HARD"
- "Budge removes barriers"
- "Baby steps to wellness"

**Music:** Relaxing, self-care vibes
