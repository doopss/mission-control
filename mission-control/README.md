## 🔌 API Usage

### Logging an Activity

```typescript
import { useMutation } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "@/convex/_generated/api";

const logActivity = useMutation(api.activities.log);

await logActivity({
  type: "task_completed",
  title: "Built Mission Control Dashboard",
  description: "Created activity feed, calendar, and search features",
  category: "development",
  status: "completed",
  duration: 120, // minutes
  relatedFiles: [
    "/mission-control/app/page.tsx",
    "/mission-control/components/ActivityFeed.tsx"
  ],
  tags: ["nextjs", "convex", "dashboard"]
});
```

### Creating a Scheduled Task

```typescript
import { useMutation } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "@/convex/_generated/api";

const createTask = useMutation(api.scheduledTasks.create);

await createTask({
  title: "Review acne app progress",
  description: "Check QA results and user feedback",
  scheduledFor: Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // Tomorrow
  priority: "high",
  category: "development",
  estimatedDuration: 60,
  tags: ["acne-app", "qa"]
});
```

### Indexing a Document

```typescript
import { useMutation } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "@/convex/_generated/api";

const indexDocument = useMutation(api.documents.index);

await indexDocument({
  path: "/workspace/memory/2026-02-08.md",
  title: "Memory Log - Feb 8, 2026",
  content: "...", // Full file content
  type: "memory",
  tags: ["daily-log", "2026"]
});
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Activity Types

Edit `components/ActivityFeed.tsx` and add to `categoryIcons` and `categoryColors`:

```typescript
const categoryIcons: Record<string, string> = {
  development: "💻",
  research: "🔍",
  communication: "💬",
  analysis: "📊",
  documentation: "📝",
  // Add your own:
  design: "🎨",
  testing: "🧪",
};
```

### Changing Color Scheme

Edit Tailwind config or update the color classes in components:
- Emerald (current primary): `emerald-500`
- Alternatives: `blue-500`, `purple-500`, `cyan-500`

---

## 📦 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```

### Deploy Convex to Production

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

Update `.env.local` with production Convex URL.

## 🔄 Integration with OpenClaw

To automatically log activities from OpenClaw sessions:

1. **Add a logging function** to your OpenClaw tools
2. **Call the Convex API** after each significant action
3. **Index workspace files** periodically (e.g., daily)

Example integration script:

```typescript
// scripts/log-to-mission-control.ts
import { ConvexHttpClient } from "convex/browser";
import { api } from "../mission-control/convex/_generated/api";

const client = new ConvexHttpClient(process.env.CONVEX_URL!);

export async function logActivity(activity: {
  type: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  // ... other fields
}) {
  await client.mutation(api.activities.log, activity);
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Convex Dev Server Won't Start
```bash
# Kill existing processes
npx convex dev --once --clear-all

# Restart
npx convex dev
```

### TypeScript Errors
```bash
# Regenerate Convex types
npx convex dev --once
```

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```
